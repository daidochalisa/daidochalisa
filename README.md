Hi! My name is Chalisa, or you can call me Dai! (not Day, not Dia, and of course, not Die LOL)

Welcome to my humble Python projects, and other coding projects like R or SQL will be coming soon.

I graduated from the University of Sheffield with a master's degree in Public Policy in 2022. 

Now I'm working for two NGOs, 'Healthwatch Tower Hamlets', and 'KNUS Mental Health', which both are focusing on health policy.

I usually use my spare time to learn something new, like coding (and farming digitally on HayDay LOL).

I aspire to utilise coding skills to make meaningful contributions to my career in health policy, whether it's through data analysis, creating innovative solutions, or enhancing advocacy efforts.
